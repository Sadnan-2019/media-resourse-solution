                    the title but will look into the broader perspectives,
                    factors and effects the foreign policy instrument has in the
                    growth and sustenance of any country in the world. But I
                    will mainly emphasize on the foreign policy outline of
                    Bangladesh as it is getting a lot of exposure and may play
                    an important role in the upcoming future. And also mainly
                    because I love my country and really want the best for my
                    motherland.

                    The foreign policy is the tool through which a country
                    negotiates, discusses and conducts trade with other nations
                    of the world. The more strong, direct and transparent the
                    policy is the better the economy, security and peaceful a
                    country is.

                    Bangladesh as we know is a small riverine country which is
                    bordered by India on all three sides and only shares a
                    border with Myanmar (Burma) on the south-east side. The
                    country is highly dependent on India for most of its Imports
                    and Exports. The Foreign Direct Investment from countries
                    however does not even count India in the top 4. It is odd
                    since India being an influential regional partner who even
                    helped the country to be liberated from the then West
                    Pakistan does not invest in Bangladesh. This is nevertheless
                    covered up by the fact that any international policies or
                    dialogue the country makes must be in-line with the national
                    interests of India. This is more assured by the support of
                    the Indian Government on the present Bangladeshi Government
                    regardless of the criticisms inside and outside the country.
                    The top Foreign Direct Investors are the U.S.A, U.K.,
                    Netherlands, Singapore and last but not the least China.
                    Presently China has overtaken the position of the top
                    Foreign Investor and has spread out its wealth in a number
                    of sectors in the country. Bangladesh in the recent years
                    has seen a surge of FDI which prompts the title of my
                    article and will ultimately make the country a key player in
                    regional politics.

                    Since the Foreign Policy of Bangladesh was always in
                    parallel and sympathetic to the Indian foreign policies,
                    Bangladesh had only one country to appease for. But now due
                    to the global shift in alliances and interests Bangladesh
                    must carefully select and direct its policies in a way that
                    it does not infuriate its neighbor and also can work with
                    countries like China who has become a threat to its neighbor
                    (India). The game has already begun when Bangladesh accepted
                    huge amounts of investment from China, when they were
                    already threatening India over territorial sovereignty of
                    the Galwan Valley and Aksai Chin. Bangladesh along with
                    other countries surrounding India has also taken support of
                    the Chinese Aggression towards India since most of them are
                    silent and bankrolled by the Chinese, for e.g. Pakistan and
                    Sri Lanka.

                    Bangladesh has a huge potential to become an international
                    hub of trade and tourism and is potentially very rich in
                    mineral resources in its Bay of Bengal which might attract
                    further investments. The country must choose its investments
                    more wisely and allocate them into appropriate sectors as it
                    can really speed up the development of the country at a
                    rapid pace. This is where the tension lies as it is always
                    seen that whenever a country starts to develop and grow the
                    powerful neighbors/neighbor tend to slow it down or even
                    create unrest just to level the playing field and influence
                    of the developing country in the region.

                    Bangladesh has enjoyed a fair amount of peace from its birth
                    in 1971. Leaving the internal political skirmishes aside
                    there has been no major international clash or threats,
                    except the dispute with Myanmar over the Rohingya issue.
                    This issue was also solved with the backing of mainly India
                    and other International countries. But what will happen if
                    India thinks that Bangladesh is lost to China ? This is the
